            <p>
                My name is Benson Mwangi Kimani I am 27 years old, currently working with Greenlife Crop Protection Africa as a field agronomist and a sales agent. I am a newbie in software engineering looking foward to exploring more in this field. Currently I enrolled to Moringa school learning both front end and back end  programming with high hopes of graduating as a fullstack developer before next year ends. I also have a degree of Arts in Economics and four years experience as an Agronomist and a sales agent for agrochemical products. I am looking forward to charging my carrier to a full time developer. The reason I chose software development is because its one field I feel I will leatrn alot and leave me a lifetime learner to remain relevant. I am planning to concentarte on Js,Python,React and Ruby on Rails in the next 2 years.
